* add developer section
	- Add tests to your contributions to avoid failing on coverage
	- Check codestyle to aboid failing on code style.
	- What to work on: implementation priorities (suggestion)
	- etc

* add code blurb to readme.
* add license reference to all files?
* check that it works on windows
* check that it works with multiple python versions. Or just specify version in readme.

* Investigate why message passing does not instantly converge after all messages has been passed once in Kalman filter
example.
* Investigate why the KL(P||Q) = KL(previously_sent_message||next_message) causes more oscilation in message passing
in the sudoku example (while causing faster convergence in KF example).
