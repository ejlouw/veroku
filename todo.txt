* Investigate why message passing does not instantly converge after all messages has been passed once in Kalman filter
example.
* Investigate why the KL(P||Q) = KL(previously_sent_message||next_message) causes more oscilation in message passing
in the sudoku example (while causing faster convergence in KF example).
