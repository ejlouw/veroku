* Add and maintain (contributor list with name and email)
*update make_random_gaussian to have non-diagonal covariances for better testing (confirm that all tests still pass)

* add code blurb to readme.
* add license reference to all files?
* check that it works on windows
* check that it works with multiple python versions. Or just specify version in readme.

* Investigate why message passing does not instantly converge after all messages has been passed once in Kalman filter
example.
* Investigate why the KL(P||Q) = KL(previously_sent_message||next_message) causes more oscilation in message passing
in the sudoku example (while causing faster convergence in KF example).
